# Reporting issues

> Dear Caramell lord, Do I really have to write this?

## Reporting Etiquette

1. Try to be as descriptive as possible.
2. Describe how to reproduce the issue.
3. Attach bug report with the issues.

## Reporting Guidelines

1. Any modifications (For example, Magisk, Xposed, or Third-Party Modifications affecting device behaviors) are not eligible for support from our team and should NOT be reported to any of our Team members in any circumstances.
2. Issues specific to an app that affect the device (For example, a particular overclocking app) should NOT be reported to our team but to the respective app's developer.

## Reporting directly through GitLab

TBD.
